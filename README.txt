# Orbits
Future Improvements:
1. Rewrite scaling to make it work better:
   i) when orbit very small, resolution is low and when orbit is very large, resolution is very high. 
   ii) Orbit doesn't always fit within screen
   iii) When side pane is resized orbit doesn't check if it's still within frame. 
   iv) orbit sometimes does unnecessary resizes when path changed.
2. Add reset orbit button
3. Add preset orbit shape buttons to demonstrate the different orbit shapes
